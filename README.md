# problem-solving-with-dsa

This repository contains my personal solutions to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems, categorized by **topic** and **difficulty level**.  
The purpose of this repository is to enhance my **problem-solving skills**, strengthen my understanding of algorithms, and serve as a **public portfolio** of my coding journey.

---

## Goals

- Solve at least **5 DSA problems per week**  
- Practice a balanced mix of **Easy, Medium, and Hard** problems  
- Maintain **clean, readable, and well-commented code**  
- Track and measure my **growth in problem-solving skills over time**  

---

## Topics Practiced

- Arrays & Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks & Queues  
- Trees & Graphs  
- Hash Tables & Heaps  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Sorting & Searching  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Greedy Algorithms  
- Graph Traversals (BFS, DFS)

---

## Categories

- **Warm-Up:** Easy-level problems focusing on fundamentals  
- **Mid-Level Challenges:** Medium difficulty, core data structures & algorithms  
- **Advanced Battles:** Hard problems requiring complex logic and optimizations
